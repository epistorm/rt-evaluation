{state_name}_line_list.csv.gz
The line list files report the hospitalizations of a synthetic epidemic across 3 locations (California, North Carolina and Massachusetts).

There are 10 stochastic realizations for each state.

Columns
-run_id: stochastic realization id
-indiv_idx: individual id
-state_name
-county_full_name
-infection_date: Date of infection (S-->L)
-hospitalization_date: Date of hospitalization 
-reporting_date: Date the hospitalization was reported in the reporting system.

{state_name}_raw_timeseries
The time series files of the SLIR model simulation of a synthetic epidemic across 3 locations (California, North Carolina and Massachusetts).

There are 10 stochastic realizations for each state/county.

Columns
-run_id: stochastic realization id
-state_name
-county_full_name
-date
-population
-geoid: county id
-new_{compartment_name}: daily number of new transitions into that compartment. new_Latent: number of S->L transitions on that day
